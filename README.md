# Snake

A good old classic Snake game with a bit of a personal design.

The main objective of the game is to feed a snake with food particles that are found at random positions. Each food eaten increases the length of a snake and its speed.

Crawl around, eat delicious cherries (that's what they have on the menu here), and try not to hit yourself or the board walls. Or... just crawl around! Who said you canâ€™t make your own rules? (Watch out for the walls, though) Of course, have fun!
